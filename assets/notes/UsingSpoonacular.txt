Spoonacular API integration in two steps:
1. Fetch random recipes by parameters, like so:
https://api.spoonacular.com/recipes/search?apiKey=baa80ca4dd1240238a3e87566c13c94f&query=biryani&number=10&instructionsRequired=true //This is with my apiKey
https://api.spoonacular.com/recipes/search?apiKey=(your apiKey)&query=biryani&number=10&instructionsRequired=true //This is generalized query

    i can change params, currenlty i am calling biryani only.

2.Now fetch recipe ingredients by passing id of the recipe.
https://api.spoonacular.com/recipes/(recipeID)/ingredientWidget.json?apiKey=baa80ca4dd1240238a3e87566c13c94f //This is with my apiKey    
https://api.spoonacular.com/recipes/(recipeID)/ingredientWidget.json?apiKey=(your apiKey) //This is generalized query

3. Fetch instructions:
https://api.spoonacular.com/recipes/(recipeID)/analyzedInstructions?apiKey=(apikey)
